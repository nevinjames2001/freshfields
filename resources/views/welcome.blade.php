                    <p>Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedemtary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surplus that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains begining at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, Sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago.</p>
                    <p>While in the digital era, agriculture is a kind of sector where people don't have interest. Other than that the major problems facing agriculture is the loss of agriculture land, becuase as more land is lost, it will become more difficult to produce the amount of food needed to feed the growing human population.</p>
                    <p>There has been a tendency for young people to shun agriculture becuase it has been associated with rural economies, so they move into urban areas to look for jobs. But the fact is that, eventually, older people will die off. We need people who can sustain agriculture to feed an increasing population. The crops of our daily need should be farmed and cultivated by the people itself</p>
